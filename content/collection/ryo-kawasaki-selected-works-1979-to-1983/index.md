After the sublime releases of parts 1 and 2 from B.J. Smiths ‘Between Ship and Shore' 3 part EP series, we take a breather before we get to the final part to bring you these selections from Japanese Jazz and electronic music legend, Ryo Kawasaki...

AUDIO SAMPLER >>> http://bit.ly/NUNS008Sampler

We have gone through Ryo’s extensive catalogue to bring you a section of what we consider are his finest works, but to be honest we could have easily added 20 more to this list.

Take a small journey through the amazing repertoire of Ryo with the 5 tracks that take in sublime jazz through to out there electronic vibes.

This release comes with extensive sleeve notes by Marc Rowlands via his interview with Ryo in October 2015
