Ambient music creates the perfect foundation for presence and deep listening. Here are some essential albums that have shaped our sound philosophy:

## Brian Eno - Music for Airports (1978)
The pioneering ambient album that defined the genre. Its gentle, looping textures create a space for contemplation without demanding attention.

## Hiroshi Yoshimura - Green (1986)
Delicate, minimalist soundscapes that evoke nature and tranquility. Perfect for afternoon listening sessions.

## Laraaji - Ambient 3: Day of Radiance (1980)
Produced by Eno, this album brings a unique shimmer and joy to ambient music through Laraaji's electric zither.

## GAS - Pop (2000)
Wolfgang Voigt's masterpiece blends ambient textures with subtle techno rhythms, creating a hypnotic forest of sound.

These albums remind us that music doesn't always need to be front and center. Sometimes, the most profound experiences come from sounds that surround us, support us, and allow us to simply be present.
